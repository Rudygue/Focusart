Focusart is app for iphone to help stay concentrate on your work for thirty minutes,like the pomodoro technique. In this app you will find a single interface with a circle timer and two buttons that helps you controll it, and funny animated pigeon mascot that is named Paolo. i take ispiration from two apps, OffScreen that i find on App Store and the simple notes on iphone.
for the aspect of the coding i'm satisfied even it's not the best i think i did good!
